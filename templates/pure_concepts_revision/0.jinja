I am writing a mnemonic story, which should connect these for concepts, upper-casing them and preserving their order:{% for component_concept in component_concepts.values() %}
- {{ component_concept }}{% endfor %}
- {{ target_concept }}

I devised the following mnemonic: {{ mnemonic }}

Please criticize that mnemonic, suggests ways to improve it, and propose 2 alternatives.
